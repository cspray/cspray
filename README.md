### Hi! :wave:

My personal project focus is on [Annotated Container](https://github.com/cspray/annotated-container), a dependency injection framework using PHP 8 Attributes! In addition to adding new features and fixing bugs, I'm also dog-fooding the library building some small apps with it.

Professionally I've convinced the team at @Roave to pay me for making their PHP code marginally less worse. Yea, I don't get it either.

If you still can't get enough of me, particularly in non-code form, check out these other cyberplaces I frequent.
