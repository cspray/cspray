### Hi! Thanks for checking out my profile!

I'm currently working on [AsyncUnit](https://github.com/labrador-kennel/async-unit) and [annotated-injector](https://github.com/cspray/annotated-injector) in preparation for improvements to [Labrador Kennel](https://labrador-kennel.io)! Contributions to these projects would be greatly welcome!

I'm an @amphp enthusiast and definitely recommend you checkout their great libraries! I have contributed to the [phpunit-util](https://github.com/amphp/phpunit-util) wrapper and have [labrador-kennel/http-cors](https://github.com/labrador-kennel/http-cors) listed as a 3rd party library for [amphp/http-server](https://github.com/amphp/http-server).

If you'd like to chat about software you can usually find me in the [StackOverflow PHP Chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php) or you can [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/charlesspray).
