### Hi! :wave:

Personal project focus is on [annotated-container](https://github.com/cspray/annotated-container). The project is a dependency injection framework powered by PHP8 Attributes! It provides an autowired, PSR-11 compatible Container that makes dependency injection easier to deal with.

I'm an @amphp enthusiast and recommend you checkout their great libraries! I have contributed to the [phpunit-util](https://github.com/amphp/phpunit-util) wrapper and have [labrador-kennel/http-cors](https://github.com/labrador-kennel/http-cors) listed as a 3rd party library for [amphp/http-server](https://github.com/amphp/http-server). I have also made contributions to other OSS projects as a part of my professional career. I highly encourage my employers to contribute back to the OSS community with both upstream contributions and funding.
