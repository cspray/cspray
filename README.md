### Hi! :wave:

Personal project focus is on [AsyncUnit](https://github.com/labrador-kennel/async-unit). AsyncUnit is a testing framework built from the ground up to support asynchronous I/O with [Amp](https://www.amphp.org)! This testing framework is being built for additional improvements to my suite of asynchronous libraries and applications built on top of Amp, [Labrador Kennel](https://labrador-kennel.io). If you're interested in asynchronous PHP or unit testing please check out the project!

I'm an @amphp enthusiast and definitely recommend you checkout their great libraries! I have contributed to the [phpunit-util](https://github.com/amphp/phpunit-util) wrapper and have [labrador-kennel/http-cors](https://github.com/labrador-kennel/http-cors) listed as a 3rd party library for [amphp/http-server](https://github.com/amphp/http-server). I have also made contributions to other OSS projects as a part of my professional career. I highly encourage my employers to contribute back to the OSS community with both upstream contributions and funding.
